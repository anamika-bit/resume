This repository has the source code and a copy of my Resume. Please provide feedback, if any.   


## Requirements and Compilation

* pdflatex + biber + pdflatex
* AltaCV uses [`fontawesome`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome) and [`academicons`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/academicons)
* Can be compiled with `pdflatex`, `XeLaTeX` and `LuaLaTeX`!
* However if you're using `academicons`, you _must_ use either `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX`. If the doc compiles but the icons don't show up in the output PDF, try compiling with `LuaLaTeX` instead.
